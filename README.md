> Yeoman generator that creates an Express REST API using an ORM (TypeORM for now)

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-express-rest-api-orm using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-express-rest-api-orm
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo express-rest-api-orm
```

This custom Yeoman generator has been modified to accept a JSON file as input rather than interrogating the user with 1,000 questions.  This makes it much easier to turn-and-burn when tweaking your generator.  It also simplifies the process of creating multiple apps - you can simply copy-paste the configuration file from an existing app and edit the new file for the new app.  Tons easier than typing in redundant data during the typical Yeoman Q&A phase.
